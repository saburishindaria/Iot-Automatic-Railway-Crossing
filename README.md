# Iot-Automatic-Railway-Crossing
The project was an automatic or unmanned Railway Level crossing. It was an IoT based project using Arduino Uno, IR Sensors and Stepper Motor, which sensed the arrival and departure of the train at the Level crossing and thereby reacted by the either opening or closing the barrier. All the data regarding moment of the barrier was then sent onto the cloud Thingspeak, where a binary graph was created for analysis. Additionally, this graph and the location of current and various other Level barriers could be viewed in an Android Application created using Android Studio.
